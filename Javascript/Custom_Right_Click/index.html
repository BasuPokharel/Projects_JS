    <h1>This project features a custom right-click (context menu) that replaces the default browser context menu my
        custom, user-friendly menu. The custom menu is designed to enhance user interaction by providing relevant and
        intuitive options based on the context of the user's actions. The main purpose of it to showcase my skills and
        affection towards js and web.<br>
        This only shows Context menu doesn't perform any task as of now I am learning web technologies so this is part
        of my practice I will implement completely functional in the future.
